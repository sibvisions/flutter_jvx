The following rules are defined by this template:

    Variable declaration at the beginning (first constants, then variables)
    Then constructors and initialization methods
    Then the implementation of abstract methods
    Then the implementation of interface methods
    Then the definition of abstract methods
    Then all overwritten methods (marked with @override)
    Then all methods of the class
    Sub/Inner classes at the end

    Each parameter of a method is marked using the prefix “p”

# Interfaces

The following rules are defined by this template:

    Constants are defined at the beginning
    Then interface methods
    Sub/Inner interfaces at the end

    Each interface starts with “I”
    Important changes are documented in the header, including time stamp and author
    Documentation for the interface declaration, ALL methods and constants
